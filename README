This is a forked version of https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage/blob/master/backbone.localStorage.js
Support for CRUD in chrome local storage [https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage.html]
Normal Backbone.sync is avaialble as ajaxSync.
Chrome local storage is asynchronous[different from default localStorage] and can store objects directly.
As default localStorage is forbidden in manifest version 2, using backbone for packaged chrome apps to work offline needed support for sync [chrome.storage.local] .
